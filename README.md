# Meet-The-Bears
Welcome to Meet the Bears! This project started from my first hackathon where my team member and I were tasked to create an interactive virtual experience for the Canadian Polar Bear Habitat. Our initial implementation was simple and can be found at: https://devpost.com/software/cph-meet-the-bears. In this new version we wanted to challenge ourselves by using unity and C# to create better graphics and add more features to the game.

In this game, players can learn interesting facts about polar bears through feeding, playing and observing them. Additonally,they can learn about the personalities of the polar bears that currently reside in the habitat. This interactive experience allows for users to experience and learn more about polar bears without having to leave their home. 

Through this project I am learning about the nuances of developing a game and the workflow of building a project in a team.
