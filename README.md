# Meet-The-Bears
Welcome to Meet the Bears! This project started from my first hackathon where my team member and I were tasked to create an interactive virtual experience for the Canadian Polar Bear Habitat. Through this game, players can learn interesting facts about polar bears through feeding, playing and observing them. Additonally,they can learn about the personalities of the polar bears that currently reside in the habitat. This interactive experience allows for users to experience and learn more about polar bears without having to leave their home. 

Through this project I am learning about the nuances of developing a game and the workflow of building a project in a team.
